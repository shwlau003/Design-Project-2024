**Micro Mouse Initial Design - EEE3088F**

This repository contains the initial design files and resources for a Micro Mouse project developed as part of the EEE3088F course (or any similar course). The Micro Mouse project aims to create an autonomous robot capable of navigating a maze environment.

**Project Overview:**

The Micro Mouse project involves designing and building a small robotic vehicle that can autonomously navigate through a maze. The robot will utilize various sensors, actuators, and control algorithms to explore the maze efficiently and find the shortest path from the starting point to the designated end point.

**Repository Contents:**

1. **Hardware Design:**
   - Schematics: Contains the schematic diagrams of the electronic circuits used in the robot, including motor drivers, sensor interfaces, and microcontroller connections.
   - PCB Layout: Includes the layout files for printed circuit boards (PCBs) designed for the robot's electronics.

2. **Software Implementation:**
   - Firmware: Contains the source code for the microcontroller firmware responsible for controlling the robot's behavior, sensor data processing, and motor control.
   - Algorithms: Includes various algorithms used for maze exploration, path planning, and navigation.

3. **Documentation:**
   - README.md: Provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup and usage, and other important information.
   - Design Documents: Includes detailed design documents, datasheets, and technical specifications for the hardware components used in the project.
   - User Manual: Provides instructions for assembling, configuring, and operating the Micro Mouse robot.

4. **Resources:**
   - Libraries: Contains any third-party libraries or dependencies used in the project.
   - Tutorials: Includes tutorials, guides, and references helpful for understanding the concepts and technologies used in the project.
